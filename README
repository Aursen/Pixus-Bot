Pixel bot for Dofus game written in C# (using VS 2013)

- what the bot can actually do :
+ Follow/repeat a specified route/path in game.
+ Job like harvest, using a predefined points/pixels list.
+ Fight, using a basic [Spell/Target] AI list.

+ what the bot doesn't do yet :
- DD management.
- Auto fighting mode (include searching for monsters).
- feel free to contribute any good ideas...


PS: This project is only for learning purpose.

Edit: This bot will probably not work on the latest game version (because of the graphic redesign of the game), but with some adjustments you can make it work.
